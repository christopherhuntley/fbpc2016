# Fairfield University Business Plan Competition website

The FBPC2016 website was built in Drupal 8. The initial build was based on [Composer Template](README_composer_template.md). The publicly accessible files (web root) are located in the `web` folder, with everything else only accessible locally. All modules and libraries are managed using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

This repository only contains the source code and standard configuration settings for the site. Configuration settings can be loaded from the `config/staging` folder using the Configuration Management menus. Content (database & media files) can be pulled downstream from a live site using [Backup and Migrate](https://www.drupal.org/project/backup_migrate).
